# RISC-V CPU

This repository is a personal projects aiming to implement a RISC-V Unpriviledged ISA from the [20250508 version of the official specification](https://docs.riscv.org/reference/isa/unpriv/unpriv-index.html)

# Developped Skills

I hope to be able to do both the design and the verification of this CPU micro-architecture thus developping my skills as a hardware engineer.

I also hope this project helps me improve my knowledge on CPUs' microarchitecture and all the constraints that come in the development of one.
